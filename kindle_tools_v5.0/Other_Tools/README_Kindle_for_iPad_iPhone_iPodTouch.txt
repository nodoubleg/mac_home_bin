Kindle for iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad
------------------------------------

The Kindle application for iOS (iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad) uses a PID derived from the serial number of the iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad. Kindlepid.pyw (see Other_Tools/Additional_Tools) is a python script that turns the serial number into the equivalent PID, which can then be used with the Calibre Plugins and DeDRM Applications.

So, to remove the DRM from (Mobipocket) Kindle books downloaded to your iPhone/iPodTouch/iPad, you’ll need the latest tools_vX.X.zip archive and
some way to extract the book files from the backup of your device on your computer. There are several free tools around to do this.

Your first step is to download and install one of the free apps onto your iPod Touch/iPhone/iPad that will find your devices's UUID.  Alternatively, you can find your device's UDID in iTunes when your device is connected in the Summary page – click on the serial number and it changes to the (40 digit!) UDID.

Once you have the UUID, double-click on KindlePID.pyw to get your device’s PID.
You should get back a response something like:

Mobipocket PID calculator for Amazon Kindle. Copyright (c) 2007, 2009 Igor Skochinsky
iPhone serial number (UDID) detected
Mobipocked PID for iPhone serial# FOURTYDIGITUDIDNUMBERGIVENHERE is TENDIGITPID

You can then add this fixed PID to the DeDRM Applications or Calibre_Plugins or KindleBooks tools and be ready to go.

You next need to find an "iPhone Extractor" or "iPhone Explorer" program for your OS that will allow you to mount your iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch as a usb device on your machine and copy your Kindle ebooks from the device back to your home machine.

Kindlefix gives you another way to use the PID generated by kindlepid. Some ebook stores and libraries will accept the PIDs generated by kindlepid (some won’t), and you can then download ebooks from the store or library encrypted to work with your Kindle. Except they don’t. There’s a flag byte set in encrypted Kindle ebooks, and Kindles and the Kindle app won’t read encrypted mobipocket ebooks unless that flag is set. Kindlefix will set that flag for you. If your library have Mobipocket ebooks to lend and will accept your Kindle’s PID, you can now check out library ebooks, run kindlefix on them, and then read them on your Kindle, and when your loan period ends, they’ll automatically become unreadable.
